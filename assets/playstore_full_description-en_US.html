Sky Map is a hand-held planetarium for your Android device.  Use it to identify stars, planets, nebulae and more. 

Originally developed as Google Sky Map, it has now been donated and open sourced.

<b>Troubleshooting/FAQ</b>
<i>The Map doesn't move/points in the wrong place</i>
Make sure you haven't switched into manual mode.  Does your phone have a compass? If not, Sky Map cannot tell your orientation.  
Look it up here: http://www.gsmarena.com/ or open Sky Map's "Diagnostics" page to see which sensors it can detect. If your phone
doesn't have a gyroscope it might help to open Sky Map's Settings/Sensor Settings and select "Disable gyro". Without a gyro
the map will be "jumpier" of course.

Try calibrating your compass by moving it in a figure of 8 motion or as described here

Are there any magnets or metal nearby that might interfere with the compass?  Try switching off "magnetic correction" (in settings) and see if that is more accurate.

<i>Why is autolocation not supported for my phone?</i>
In Android 6 the way permissions work has changed.  You need to enable the location permission setting for Sky Map as described here:

<i>Do I need an internet connection?<i>
No, but some functions (like entering your location manually) won't work without one.  You'll have to use the GPS or enter a latitude and longitude instead.

<i>Can I help test the latest features?</i>
Sure!  Join our beta testing program and get the latest version.
